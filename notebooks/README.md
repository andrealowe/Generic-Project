# Notebooks

Exploratory data analysis, research, and experimentation notebooks.

## Organization

```
notebooks/
├── 01_data_exploration/     # EDA and data quality analysis
├── 02_model_development/    # Model training experiments
├── 03_model_evaluation/     # Performance analysis and testing
└── 04_deployment_prep/      # Production readiness validation
```

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive names with numbering (e.g., `01_explore_customer_churn.ipynb`)
- Include markdown explanations of your thought process
- Clean up notebooks before committing (clear outputs if sensitive)
- Move production-ready code to `src/` when finalized
