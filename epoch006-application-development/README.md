# Epoch 006: Application Development

## Purpose
Create user-facing applications and interfaces that enable stakeholders to interact with validated ML models effectively.

## Assumptions
Validated models provide stable APIs and technology recommendations align with organizational infrastructure requirements.

## Findings
Optimal user interface frameworks selected, interactive dashboard designs validated through user testing, and application architecture designed for scalability.

## Metrics
User interface responsiveness measurements, user experience satisfaction scores, and application deployment success rate.

## Successes
Production-ready applications deployed with intuitive interfaces, interactive dashboards created for real-time insights, and technology stack successfully integrated.

## Failures
Some advanced visualization requirements may exceed framework capabilities and user interface complexity could overwhelm certain stakeholder groups.

## Next Steps
Transition to production deployment with comprehensive monitoring and user support documentation.

## Agent
Use `Front-End-Developer-Agent` for tasks in this stage.
