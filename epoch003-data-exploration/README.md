# Epoch 003: Data Exploration

## Purpose
Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand data characteristics, identify patterns, and generate actionable insights.

## Assumptions
Cleaned datasets from data wrangling phase provide sufficient quality for meaningful analysis.

## Findings
Key data patterns and relationships identified through statistical analysis with feature distributions and correlations documented.

## Metrics
Insight generation rate, data coverage completeness percentage, and visualization effectiveness score.

## Successes
Comprehensive EDA notebooks created with statistical summaries, feature importance rankings established, and actionable recommendations provided.

## Failures
Some complex relationships may require advanced statistical techniques and domain expert availability could limit validation.

## Next Steps
Proceed to model development using insights to guide feature selection and engineering.

## Agent
Use `Data-Scientist-Agent` for tasks in this stage.
