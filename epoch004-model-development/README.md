# Epoch 004: Model Development

## Purpose
Design, train, and optimize machine learning models using insights from data exploration phase.

## Assumptions
Data exploration insights provide clear guidance for feature selection and computing resources are sufficient for training.

## Findings
Optimal algorithm families identified, feature engineering strategies validated, and hyperparameter optimization completed.

## Metrics
Model performance scores, training efficiency metrics, and experiment tracking completeness.

## Successes
Best-performing model identified through rigorous testing, hyperparameter optimization achieved improvements, and model artifacts properly versioned.

## Failures
Some complex algorithms may require extended training time and feature engineering experiments might not yield expected improvements.

## Next Steps
Proceed to comprehensive model testing phase for production readiness validation.

## Agent
Use `Model-Developer-Agent` for tasks in this stage.
