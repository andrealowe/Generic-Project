# Epoch 005: Model Testing

## Purpose
Conduct comprehensive testing and validation of trained models to ensure production readiness, regulatory compliance, and business requirement satisfaction.

## Assumptions
Trained models meet basic performance thresholds and comprehensive test data scenarios are available for evaluation.

## Findings
Model performance validated across functional requirements, fairness testing demonstrates regulatory adherence, and robustness testing reveals behavior under adversarial conditions.

## Metrics
Test coverage percentage, performance degradation metrics, and compliance score.

## Successes
Comprehensive test suite executed successfully, model robustness validated against adversarial attacks, and production readiness certification achieved.

## Failures
Some edge case scenarios may reveal unexpected behavior and performance under extreme conditions might degrade beyond thresholds.

## Next Steps
Transition to deployment and MLOps phase using validated model artifacts and test results.

## Agent
Use `Model-Tester-Agent` for tasks in this stage.
