# Domino ML Agents Template 🤖

> A comprehensive collection of specialized Claude Code agents for building end-to-end machine learning demonstrations on the Domino Data Lab platform.

![Domino ML Agents Overview](./assets/images/domino-ml-agents-overview.png)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Create a new Domino project** using this template
2. **Launch Claude Code** in your Domino workspace
3. **Start building** with one simple command:

```python
# For a complete ML pipeline
"Build an end-to-end customer churn prediction system with dashboard"

# For quick prototyping
"Create a fraud detection model demo with synthetic data"
```

## 📋 What's Included

This template provides **8 specialized agents** that work together to create production-ready ML solutions:

| Agent | Purpose | Key Capabilities |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| 🎯 **Master Project Manager** | Orchestration | End-to-end pipeline coordination |
| 🔍 **Data Wrangler** | Data Management | Data acquisition, quality, pipelines |
| 📊 **Data Scientist** | Analysis & Insights | EDA, visualizations, feature engineering |
| 🧠 **Model Developer** | ML Development | Training, optimization, experimentation |
| ✅ **Model Validator** | Quality Assurance | Performance validation, robustness testing |
| 💼 **Business Analyst** | Requirements | Business-to-technical translation |
| 🚀 **MLOps Engineer** | Deployment | Production pipelines, monitoring |
| 🎨 **Frontend Developer** | UI/UX | Dashboards, apps, visualizations |

![Use Cases](./assets/images/use-cases-grid.png)

## 🎯 Getting Started

### Option 1: Complete Pipeline
Use the **Master Project Manager** for end-to-end automation:

```python
"Build a complete fraud detection system for credit card transactions"
```

This will:
1. 📊 Generate synthetic transaction data
2. 🔍 Perform exploratory data analysis
3. 🧠 Train and optimize ML models
4. ✅ Validate model performance and fairness
5. 🚀 Create deployment pipeline
6. 🎨 Build interactive dashboard

### Option 2: Individual Agents
Work with specific agents for targeted tasks:

```python
# Data acquisition
"Generate synthetic customer data for churn prediction"

# Model development
"Train an XGBoost model for this dataset with hyperparameter tuning"

# Dashboard creation
"Create a Streamlit app for model predictions with real-time updates"
```

## 📈 MLflow Integration

All agents automatically integrate with MLflow for comprehensive experiment tracking:

- **🔄 Parent-child run hierarchy** for complex workflows
- **📊 Automatic metric logging** (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- **🎯 Model registry** with signatures and input examples
- **📁 Artifact tracking** (models, plots, reports, data)

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Project Settings
Configure your project by updating the settings in any agent interaction:

```python
settings = {
    "project": "customer_analytics",
    "target_metric": "f1_score",
    "deployment_strategy": "canary",
    "ui_complexity": "medium",
    "compliance_requirements": ["GDPR", "SOX"]
}
```

### Agent Customization
Each agent can be customized for specific requirements:
- **Data Wrangler**: Custom data sources, quality rules
- **Model Developer**: Specific algorithms, evaluation metrics
- **Frontend Developer**: UI framework preferences, styling
- **MLOps Engineer**: Deployment platforms, monitoring tools
