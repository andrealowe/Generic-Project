## Quick Start

### Complete Project Generation

Simply describe what you want to build:

```python
"Create a customer churn prediction system with real-time scoring"
```

This single command will:
1. ‚úÖ Generate synthetic customer data
2. ‚úÖ Perform comprehensive EDA
3. ‚úÖ Train multiple ML models
4. ‚úÖ Validate for bias and fairness
5. ‚úÖ Deploy production API
6. ‚úÖ Create interactive dashboard
7. ‚úÖ Set up monitoring

### Targeted Development

Focus on specific phases of your project:

```python
# Start with data
"Generate synthetic financial transaction data for fraud detection"

# Focus on modeling
"Build an ensemble model for this dataset optimizing for precision"

# Create visualization
"Build a Streamlit dashboard showing model predictions and explanations"
```
