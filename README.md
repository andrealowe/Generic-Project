### Design Philosophy

**Research vs. Production Separation**
- Keep exploratory work in `notebooks/` for iteration and discovery
- Move production-ready code to `src/` for deployment and maintenance
- This accelerates delivery by clearly defining research vs. production phases

**Modularity & Testability**
- Each component in `src/` is independently testable
- Configuration separated from code for environment flexibility
- Clear interfaces between data, features, models, and deployment

## Enhanced Testing Capabilities

### Comprehensive Model Validation
- **Functional Testing**: Basic prediction validation and format compliance
- **Performance Testing**: Latency (P95), throughput, resource utilization
- **Edge Case Testing**: Missing values, outliers, boundary conditions
