# Epoch 002: Data Wrangling

## Purpose
Acquire, clean, and prepare high-quality datasets for machine learning development.

## Assumptions
Required data sources are accessible and data quality issues can be identified and remediated through automated processes.

## Findings
Primary data sources identified, data quality issues catalogued, and synthetic data generation strategies validated.

## Metrics
Data quality score, data coverage percentage, and processing efficiency metrics.

## Successes
Clean analysis-ready datasets created, data pipeline established for reproducible workflows, and privacy-compliant synthetic data generated.

## Failures
Some expected data sources may be unavailable and certain data quality issues might require manual intervention.

## Next Steps
Transition to exploratory data analysis using prepared datasets for insight generation.

## Agent
Use `Data-Wrangler-Agent` for tasks in this stage.
